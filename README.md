# Java-defence-system

Introduction:
The Defense System project aims to create a simulated system that manages and monitors various
defense units, including Helicopters, Tanks, and Submarines. The project emphasizes
communication, coordination, and information exchange between these defense units.


Project Overview:
The project seems to simulate a defense system with various components, such as helicopters, tanks,
and submarines. These components are represented as Swing GUI windows (Helicopter, Tank, and
Submarine classes) and interact with a central controller (MainController) and an observer pattern
(Observer).
Project Requirements


● Simulate a defense system with different types of units.
● Each unit has unique features and attributes.
● Implement communication and coordination between defense units.
● Visualize the system with graphical user interfaces for each defense unit.
● Provide a central controller (Observer) for managing and observing the system.
● Simulate strength updates, area messages, and message broadcasts.
